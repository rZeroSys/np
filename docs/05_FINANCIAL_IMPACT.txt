--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Calculate Annual HVAC Costs by Fuel Type

  Electricity HVAC Cost = total_annual_electricity_cost x pct_elec_hvac
  Gas HVAC Cost = annual_gas_cost x pct_gas_hvac
  Steam HVAC Cost = annual_steam_cost x pct_steam_hvac
  Fuel Oil HVAC Cost = annual_fuel_oil_cost x pct_fuel_oil_hvac

  Total HVAC Cost = Sum of all fuel HVAC costs


STEP 2: Calculate Annual ODCV Utility Savings

  odcv_dollar_savings = Total HVAC Cost x odcv_savings_pct

The odcv_hvac_savings_pct ranges from 20-40% for office buildings, with
type-specific ranges for other building types based on:
  - Vacancy rates (for multi-tenant buildings)
  - Utilization rates (for owner-occupied buildings)
  - Building age and size (automation likelihood proxy)
  - Energy efficiency (Energy Star score or EUI)
  - Climate zone (heating/cooling intensity)


STEP 3: Calculate Total Annual OpEx Avoidance (Including BPS Fine Avoidance)

For buildings in BPS jurisdictions, ODCV reduces carbon emissions, which
can help avoid or reduce regulatory penalties:

  total_annual_opex_avoidance = odcv_dollar_savings + fine_avoidance_yr1

Where:
  odcv_hvac_savings_annual_usd: Annual utility cost savings
  bps_fine_avoided_yr1_usd: Year 1 BPS penalty avoidance

Both utility savings and regulatory penalty avoidance contribute to
increased Net Operating Income (NOI).


STEP 4: Calculate Valuation Impact (Income Capitalization Approach)

Commercial real estate is valued based on income-producing potential.
Operating expense reductions directly increase NOI, which increases value:

  odcv_valuation_impact_usd = total_annual_opex_avoidance / (cap_rate / 100)

IMPORTANT: The val_cap_rate_pct column stores values as decimals
(e.g., 0.075 for 7.5%). For valuation calculation, use directly.

In income-producing properties, a $1 reduction in operating expenses
increases NOI by $1. The capitalization rate converts this income stream
into property value.

Example:
  $100,000 annual benefit / 0.07 (7% cap rate) = $1,428,571 valuation increase


VALUE MULTIPLIER BY CAP RATE:
  Cap Rate    Value Multiplier    Example Impact
  --------------------------------------------------
  6.00%       16.67x              $100K savings = $1.67M value
  7.00%       14.29x              $100K savings = $1.43M value
  8.00%       12.50x              $100K savings = $1.25M value
  9.00%       11.11x              $100K savings = $1.11M value


STEP 5: Estimate Current and Post-ODCV Valuations

Current Valuation (estimated):
  Estimated Gross Income = Total Energy Cost / 0.12
    (Energy typically ~12% of gross income for commercial properties)

  Estimated NOI = Estimated Gross Income x 0.60
    (Operating expenses typically 35-45% of gross income)

  current_valuation_usd = Estimated NOI / cap_rate

Post-ODCV Valuation:
  post_odcv_valuation_usd = current_valuation_usd + odcv_valuation_impact_usd

SECTION 3: TOTAL ANNUAL OPEX AVOIDANCE
================================================================================

WHAT IS TOTAL ANNUAL OPEX AVOIDANCE?
------------------------------------
Operating expenses avoided each year from ODCV implementation:

  total_annual_opex_avoidance = odcv_dollar_savings + fine_avoidance_yr1

Component                      What It Is
---------------------------------------------------------
odcv_hvac_savings_annual_usd   Utility bills not paid (lower energy use)
bps_fine_avoided_yr1_usd       BPS fines not paid (lower emissions)

Both are operating expenses (OpEx) the building avoids paying.


WHY "OPEX AVOIDANCE" AND NOT "TOTAL BENEFIT"?
---------------------------------------------
The total benefit of ODCV includes:

Benefit                  Column                         In OpEx Avoidance?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utility savings          odcv_hvac_savings_annual_usd   Yes
Fine avoidance           bps_fine_avoided_yr1_usd       Yes
Property value increase  val_odcv_impact_usd            No

Calling it "total benefit" would be wrong because valuation increase is
ALSO a benefit. "Total Annual OpEx Avoidance" accurately describes the
operating expenses avoided, not all benefits.


HOW IT FLOWS TO VALUATION
-------------------------
  total_annual_opex_avoidance  -->  odcv_valuation_impact_usd
  (annual cash savings)             (property value increase)

The OpEx avoidance improves NOI, which capitalizes into higher property value.


EXAMPLE
-------
Building: 500,000 sqft office in Washington, DC

  Item                          Amount
  -------------------------------------------
  Utility savings               $300,000/year
  Fine avoidance                $800,000/year
  Total Annual OpEx Avoidance   $1,100,000/year
  Valuation Impact ($1.1M / 7%) $15,714,286


================================================================================
SECTION 4: FORMULA CHAIN
================================================================================

1. odcv_dollar_savings = total_hvac_energy_cost x odcv_savings_pct

2. fine_avoidance_yr1 = (emissions over cap) x penalty rate

3. total_annual_opex_avoidance = odcv_dollar_savings + fine_avoidance_yr1

4. odcv_valuation_impact_usd = total_annual_opex_avoidance / cap_rate

5. post_odcv_valuation_usd = current_valuation_usd + odcv_valuation_impact_usd


================================================================================
SECTION 5: HVAC PERCENTAGES (MEDIANS FOR GAP-FILLING)
================================================================================

Fuel Type         HVAC % of Total Use
---------------------------------------
Natural Gas       85%
District Steam    99%
Fuel Oil          78%
Electricity       Building-specific


================================================================================
SECTION 6: ENERGY COST ASSUMPTIONS
================================================================================

- Energy costs represent approximately 12% of gross rental income
- Operating expense ratio: 40% of gross income (60% NOI margin)
- These are industry-standard benchmarks for commercial properties


================================================================================
SECTION 7: KEY POINTS
================================================================================

1. Both components are OpEx - utility costs and fines are operating expenses

2. Non-BPS buildings have $0 fine avoidance, so OpEx avoidance = utility
   savings only

3. Fine avoidance is Year 1 - BPS caps get stricter over time, so future
   years will differ

4. Valuation is separate - the property value increase is calculated FROM
   the OpEx avoidance


================================================================================
SECTION 8: OUTPUT COLUMNS
================================================================================

odcv_hvac_savings_annual_usd     Annual utility cost savings from ODCV ($)
savings_opex_avoided_annual_usd  Combined utility savings + BPS fine avoidance ($)
val_current_usd                  Estimated current property value
val_post_odcv_usd                Estimated property value after ODCV
val_odcv_impact_usd              Dollar increase in property value


================================================================================
SECTION 9: IMPACT METRICS EXPLANATIONS
================================================================================

These explanations are used in the UI to help users understand each metric.

UTILITY COST SAVINGS
--------------------
Annual dollar savings from reducing HVAC energy waste. Calculated by:
(1) Taking actual energy costs from city benchmarking disclosure filings
(2) Applying CBECS data to determine HVAC percentage by building type -
    offices average 44% electricity and 60% gas to HVAC; hotels just 20%
    gas due to hot water and kitchen loads
(3) Multiplying by ODCV savings percentage, which accounts for vacancy
    (CBRE/Cushman & Wakefield data) and utilization (Kastle Systems badge
    swipes for offices, STR data for hotels, NCES for schools)

PROPERTY VALUE INCREASE
-----------------------
Commercial property values are determined by Net Operating Income (NOI)
divided by capitalization rate. Every dollar of annual operating cost
savings flows directly to NOI. At a 7% cap rate, $100,000 in annual
savings adds $1.43M to property value. For buildings with fine avoidance,
we also capitalize the avoided penalties.

per Appraisal Institute standards.

ENERGY STAR SCORE
-----------------
Ranks building from 1-100 against similar buildings nationwide - score of
50 means median performance, 75+ earns certification. EPA calculates using
source energy (not site energy), normalized for weather, hours of operation,
and other factors. Post-ODCV score improvement projected using EPA regression
equations. Reducing electricity by 10% typically improves score by 3-5 points.

Source: EPA ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager Technical Reference

CARBON REDUCTION
----------------
Calculated from actual fuel consumption using EPA eGRID emission factors for
electricity (varies by grid region - California at 0.21 kg CO2/kWh vs Midwest
at 0.41 kg CO2/kWh) and standard combustion factors for natural gas (5.3 kg
CO2 per therm), fuel oil (10.2 kg CO2 per gallon), and district steam.

Source: EPA eGRID 2022, EIA emission factors

SITE EUI
--------
Site EUI (Energy Use Intensity) measures total energy consumption per square
foot in kBtu/sqft. Calculated from benchmarking disclosure:
(electricity kWh x 3.412 + gas therms x 100 + steam MMBtu x 1000 + fuel oil
gallons x 138.5) / gross floor area.

Buildings above the median have more waste to capture; buildings below are
already efficient.

LOAD FACTOR
-----------
Measures how evenly building uses electricity throughout the month -
calculated as average demand / peak demand. A low load factor means sharp
demand spikes that utilities penalize; a high load factor means steady,
predictable consumption. ODCV can improve load factor by reducing
ventilation during unoccupied periods.

TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS
-------------------
Total greenhouse gas emissions in metric tons CO2e/year, calculated from
actual fuel consumption: electricity x grid factor + natural gas x 5.3 kg
CO2/therm + steam x steam factor. For context, one metric ton CO2 equals
driving 2,500 miles or powering a home for 1.2 months.


================================================================================
SECTION 10: LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
================================================================================

1. Valuation estimates are indicative: Actual property values depend on
   many factors beyond energy costs (location, condition, lease terms, etc.)

2. Cap rates are market-dependent: Actual cap rates vary by market,
   property class, and economic conditions

3. ODCV savings are estimated: Actual savings depend on existing HVAC
   systems, building controls, and implementation quality

4. Year 1 fine avoidance only: BPS penalties may escalate in future
   compliance periods; this analysis uses Year 1 values as baseline

5. BPS law changes: Building Performance Standards are evolving; caps
   and penalties may change
