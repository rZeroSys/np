# ODCV Savings Tooltips by Building Type

Tooltips for salespeople explaining HVAC savings potential (20-50% range).

---

## HIGH OPPORTUNITY (30%+ average savings)

### K-12 School (38-45% savings)
Schools are empty 3+ months/year (summer, holidays, weekends) but HVAC often runs year-round for maintenance and programs. During school days, classrooms average 65-75% occupancy with significant empty periods between classes. Gyms, auditoriums, and cafeterias sit empty most of the day.

### Venue (27-45% savings)
Arenas, concert halls, and convention centers are EMPTY 80%+ of the time. A typical arena hosts 60-80 events/year—that's only 300-400 hours of actual use out of 8,760 hours/year. Yet HVAC conditions these massive spaces continuously for maintenance and pre-event prep.

### Higher Ed (24-45% savings)
Universities have dramatic occupancy swings: summer break (12+ weeks), winter break, spring break, plus evenings and weekends. Lecture halls designed for 300 students often have 50. Research buildings run 24/7 HVAC for 9-5 occupancy. Dorms empty during breaks.

### Theater (25-40% savings)
Broadway runs 8 shows/week × 3 hours = 24 hours of performances out of 168 hours/week. Even adding rehearsals and pre-show HVAC, theaters operate at 15-20% utilization. Movie theaters fare slightly better but still average 30% seat occupancy across all showings.

### Office (22-40% savings)
Post-COVID reality: Kastle Systems shows 50% average badge-ins nationally. Add 15-25% vacancy rates (SF: 34%, NYC: 15%) and you get massive over-ventilation. A building designed for 1,000 people often has 300-400 present. San Francisco offices see only 38% of pre-pandemic occupancy.

### Inpatient Hospital (22-37% savings)
Not just patient rooms! Hospitals have huge non-clinical areas ventilated at medical-grade rates 24/7: waiting rooms (30% occupied), exam rooms (35% occupied), admin offices (40% occupied), cafeterias (35% occupied). Only ICU and OR run near capacity. Weighted building utilization: ~56-60%.

### Medical Office (22-40% savings)
Exam rooms sit empty between patients—each 15-30 minute appointment means the room is unoccupied 50-70% of operating hours. MGMA benchmarks show providers see 20-25 patients/day across 6-8 exam rooms. Add nights/weekends = closed, and real utilization is 40-50%.

### Mixed Use (21-38% savings)
Office floors follow Kastle data (45-55% occupancy), retail floors follow traffic patterns (40-50%). Multi-tenant means vacancy challenges similar to office. Central HVAC controlled by landlord = same over-ventilation problem as pure office buildings.

## MODERATE OPPORTUNITY (22-29% average savings)

### Specialty Hospital (22-33% savings)
Rehab facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and specialty care have similar patterns to inpatient hospitals. Large waiting areas, admin offices, and therapy rooms are over-ventilated. True utilization 55-60% when accounting for all building zones.

### Hotel (20-35% savings)
Average US hotel occupancy: 63%. But rooms are only occupied ~10 hours/day (evening to morning). Meeting rooms: booked 40% of time. Lobbies: 30% capacity average. Restaurants: meal rush only. HVAC runs 24/7 in all spaces regardless of occupancy.

### Outpatient Clinic (20-32% savings)
Same pattern as medical office—exam rooms ventilated at medical-grade rates but patients only present for brief appointments. Operating hours: 8am-5pm weekdays. Effective utilization across exam rooms, waiting areas, and admin: 42-48%.

### Retail Store (20-34% savings)
Foot traffic varies dramatically: weekday mornings see 15-25% of design capacity, weekend afternoons hit 60-80%. Stores condition for peak traffic 100% of operating hours. Back rooms and stockrooms (20-30% of space) see minimal occupancy.

### Enclosed Mall (20-29% savings)
Retail apocalypse reality: many malls have 15-30% vacancy from anchor store closures. Common areas (food courts, hallways) conditioned regardless of traffic. Weekday mornings: 10-20% of capacity. Average across all hours: 35-40% utilization.

### Library/Museum (20-27% savings)
HVAC runs 24/7 for collection preservation (temperature/humidity control), but visitors are sparse. Open ~50 hours/week with 30-40% average occupancy during those hours. True utilization: 12-15%. Galleries designed for 200 visitors often have 20.

## LIMITED OPPORTUNITY (20-22% average savings)

### Wholesale Club (20-22% savings)
Shorter hours than grocery (10am-8:30pm) and weekend-heavy traffic. Key insight: 30-40% of building is warehouse/stock room with only forklift drivers present. Sales floor averages 48% traffic, stock areas 10%. Blended: ~33% utilization.

### Restaurant/Bar (20-24% savings)
Kitchen exhaust hoods must run at full blast during all cooking—not demand-controllable. ODCV opportunity exists only in dining areas (~60% of space). Dining follows meal patterns: packed at lunch/dinner, empty between. Kitchen limits overall savings potential.

### Supermarket/Grocery (20% savings)
Longer hours (6am-midnight) than most retail, but still variable traffic. Open 126 hrs/week, but mornings and late nights see 20-30% of design. Food safety requirements limit how much ventilation can be reduced in refrigerated areas.

### Residential Care (20% savings)
Legitimately low opportunity—residents actually live there 24/7. Unlike hospitals where patients come and go, assisted living and nursing home residents are present continuously. Savings limited to common areas during overnight hours.

## ZERO OPPORTUNITY

### Data Center (0% savings)
Cooling is for equipment, not people. Server rooms require constant temperature regardless of human occupancy. No ODCV opportunity exists—ventilation rates are driven by heat load from servers, not occupancy.

## Key Talking Points for Sales

1. **"Design vs. Reality"**: Buildings are designed for peak occupancy that rarely occurs. A conference room for 20 people sits empty 80% of the time but gets ventilated as if full.

2. **"The Vacancy Double-Whammy"**: Office buildings have both vacancy (empty suites) AND utilization issues (WFH means leased space is half-empty). Formula: Vacancy + (1-Vacancy) × (1-Utilization) = Total Waste.

3. **"24/7 Problem"**: Many buildings run HVAC continuously regardless of occupancy. Hospitals condition waiting rooms at 2am. Museums climate-control empty galleries all night. Offices pre-condition for arrivals that never come.

4. **"The Stock Room Insight"**: Wholesale clubs and retail have 20-40% of space as back-of-house with almost no one in it—but fully conditioned.

5. **"Event Space Reality"**: Venues, theaters, and event spaces are empty 80%+ of the time. They're designed for 5,000 people but conditioning for 0 most hours.
