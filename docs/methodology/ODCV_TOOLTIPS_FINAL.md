All tooltips for UI display. Each explains methodology, data sources, and market variation.

---

## Office
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. We calculate this using federal CBECS survey data for how much energy goes to HVAC, city-specific office vacancy rates from CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield, and real occupancy data from Kastle Systems badge swipes. Buildings in cities with lower office attendance (San Francisco at 38%) show higher savings potential than cities with stronger return-to-office (New York at 55%). Adjusted for building age and current efficiency."

## Hotel
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual room occupancy. Room occupancy (STR data: NYC 87%, national 63%) times guest presence (~45% of the day—the rest they're out at meetings, sightseeing, dining) gives true utilization. A 63%-occupied hotel runs just 28% actual utilization—meaning 72% of ventilation conditions empty rooms. High-occupancy markets like NYC show less savings potential than lower-occupancy markets like Denver or Atlanta."

## K-12 School
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Schools operate roughly 180 days per year, 7 hours per day—just 22-28% of annual hours depending on state. We calculate utilization using NCES instructional day requirements and state-level data on year-round school adoption. California schools (more year-round programs) run 28% utilization; Minnesota schools (traditional calendar, harsh winters) run 21%. Buildings empty 72-80% of the time."

## Retail Store
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual customer traffic instead of design capacity. Stores are built for peak crowds but average 35-45% capacity: slow mornings at 15-20%, lunch and evening rushes at 60-80%, overnight at zero. Urban locations with steadier foot traffic (NYC ~45%) show less savings than suburban stores with sharper peaks and valleys (~35%). The opportunity is in not ventilating for a full store during slow periods."

## Higher Ed
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Universities have extreme schedule-driven vacancy: only ~32 weeks in session per year, and during those weeks classrooms average just 35% utilization—most rooms sit empty between classes. Total building utilization runs 24-30% depending on academic calendar (California's quarter system and summer sessions push higher; cold-climate schools with long winter breaks run lower). Buildings empty 70-76% of the time."

## Residential Care
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Unlike hotels or offices, residents live on-site 24/7—sleeping, eating, spending most hours in the building. We use NIC MAP Vision Q4 2024 occupancy data: Boston 91%, Denver 86%, Atlanta 84%. With residents present ~95% of the time, there's far less empty space to recover compared to offices or schools that clear out nights and weekends."

## Medical Office
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Medical offices get 2-3x the airflow of regular offices under ASHRAE 62.1 healthcare standards—even waiting rooms receive medical-grade ventilation. We use CBRE 2024-2025 data showing 9.5% vacancy (versus 20%+ for regular offices) and MGMA benchmarks showing 70% exam room utilization during business hours. The opportunity: exam rooms sit empty between appointments while still receiving full infection-control airflow."

## Supermarket/Grocery
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Supermarkets operate long hours with steady traffic—but still swing between peaks and lulls. We use Placer.ai foot traffic data: peak hours (5-7pm) hit 80-100% capacity, off-peak (early morning, late night) drops to 15-30%. Weighted average: 45-55% of design. Refrigeration cases also benefit—lower ventilation means reduced humidity loads. Research from Purdue and ASHRAE RP-1747 confirms retail DCV savings potential."

## Specialty Hospital
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Specialty hospitals—psychiatric, rehab, children's, cancer centers—are limited-opportunity: they run 24/7 with patients who stay continuously, unlike hotel guests who leave during the day. We use AHA bed occupancy data showing 65-80% depending on specialty and market (Boston and Chicago run higher). ASHRAE 170 mandates 15-25 air changes per hour in critical areas regardless of census—those rates can't drop. Savings come mainly from admin areas and waiting rooms during off-hours."

## Inpatient Hospital
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. While hospitals are a limited-opportunity building type due to 24/7 operation and infection control requirements, significant savings come from non-clinical areas that are over-ventilated at medical-grade rates around the clock. Waiting rooms sit empty overnight, exam rooms are only periodically occupied, administrative offices have business-hours-only staff, and cafeterias see variable traffic—yet all receive the same aggressive ventilation as patient rooms. We calculate building-wide utilization by weighting patient rooms (40% of building at 70% bed occupancy), clinical areas (20% at 85%), and these underutilized support spaces. ASHRAE 170 mandates minimum rates that can't be reduced in critical areas, but waiting rooms, admin, and lobbies offer real opportunity."

## Mixed Use
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Mixed-use buildings—typically office towers with ground-floor retail—run centralized HVAC that ventilates vacant floors at near-design rates. We use the same sources as offices: city vacancy from CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield (14-30% by market) and Kastle badge-swipe utilization (36-52%). Opportunity comes from both vacant space and leased space with low attendance. Premium urban buildings may have lower vacancy but face the same WFH-driven utilization gap."

## Wholesale Club
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Wholesale clubs have 30-40% of the building in back-of-house stock and warehouse space with almost nobody in it—just occasional forklift operators restocking shelves. We weight the sales floor (60% of building at ~48% customer traffic) against these giant empty stock areas (40% at ~10% occupancy), giving 30-38% true building-wide utilization. Weekend-heavy traffic patterns and shorter hours than grocery stores (typically 10am-8:30pm) add further variability."

## Venue
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Arenas, concert halls, and convention centers are empty 80%+ of the time—a typical arena hosts 60-80 events per year, totaling just 300-400 hours of actual use out of 8,760 hours annually. We calculate utilization from event schedules and industry data: an NBA arena with 41 home games plus 30-40 concerts and events runs ~550 hours of HVAC-on time (including pre-event conditioning). That's 6-7% of the year. Even adding maintenance conditioning, true utilization runs 15-22%. Boston and New York (more college events, concerts) run higher; smaller markets run lower."

## Theater
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Theaters sit empty most of the time—Broadway runs 8 shows per week × 3 hours = just 24 hours of performances out of 168 weekly hours. Adding pre-show HVAC warmup (1 hour), post-show (30 minutes), and tech rehearsals brings total conditioned time to ~35 hours per week—21% of the time. During shows, occupancy averages 70-80% (not every performance sells out). True utilization: 14-22%. Movie theaters fare slightly better with 12-hour daily operation but average just 30% seat occupancy across all showings. New York (Broadway density) runs higher utilization than regional markets."

## Restaurant/Bar
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Restaurants present a split opportunity: kitchen exhaust hoods must run at full blast during all cooking hours (400-1,800 CFM per hood for grease-laden air)—that's not demand-controllable. The opportunity exists in dining areas, which comprise ~60% of the building. Dining rooms follow meal patterns: packed during lunch (11am-2pm at 50-70% capacity) and dinner (5pm-10pm at 60-90%), nearly empty between. We weight kitchen (40% of space, limited ODCV) against dining (60% of space, variable occupancy) to calculate building-wide savings potential. Late-night markets like NYC and Boston run slightly higher utilization."

## Library/Museum
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Libraries and museums run HVAC 24/7 for collection preservation—temperature at 68-72°F and humidity at 45-55% RH to protect books, art, and artifacts—but visitors are sparse. Typical hours: 50 per week open to the public, with average occupancy of 30-40% during those hours. True visitor-driven utilization: 10-15%. Major institutions (Smithsonian museums, Boston MFA, NYC Met) run higher traffic; regional libraries and smaller museums run lower. The opportunity: conditioning galleries and reading rooms at preservation levels around the clock while actual visitors occupy them just 10-15% of the time."

## Outpatient Clinic
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Outpatient clinics follow the same pattern as medical offices—exam rooms ventilated at medical-grade rates (2-3x standard office per ASHRAE 62.1) but patients only present for 15-30 minute appointments. Between patients, rooms sit empty but fully ventilated. We use MGMA benchmarks: providers see 20-25 patients per day across 6-8 exam rooms, meaning each room is occupied just 25-35% of operating hours. Operating hours themselves are limited: 8am-5pm weekdays, some Saturday mornings. Weighted building utilization (exam rooms, waiting areas, admin) runs 42-48%. Major medical markets like Boston run slightly higher."

## Enclosed Mall
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Enclosed malls face both vacancy and traffic challenges—the retail apocalypse has pushed inline store vacancy to 15-30% in many properties as anchor stores (Sears, JCPenney, Macy's) close. We use ICSC and Placer.ai data: weekday morning traffic runs 10-20% of design capacity, weekend afternoons hit 60-80%. Common areas—food courts, hallways, entrances—get fully conditioned regardless of whether 100 or 1,000 shoppers are present. Weighted average utilization runs 35-45%. Premium malls in Boston and Cambridge run higher; struggling properties in secondary markets run lower."

## Data Center
"Data centers have zero ODCV savings potential. Cooling requirements are driven entirely by server heat loads, not human occupancy. A data center with 2 people or 20 people requires the same precise temperature and humidity control to prevent equipment failure. Ventilation rates are set by IT equipment density and heat rejection needs—ASHRAE recommends 64-80°F inlet temperatures regardless of occupancy. There is no opportunity to reduce conditioning based on human presence."

## Strip Mall
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Strip malls combine vacancy challenges (individual tenant spaces go empty during turnover) with retail traffic patterns. We use vacancy data from CBRE and CoStar: strip mall vacancy runs 8-15% depending on market, with higher turnover than enclosed malls. Individual stores follow retail traffic patterns—busy evenings and weekends, slow weekday mornings. Tenant spaces are typically served by individual rooftop units, making demand-based ventilation straightforward to implement. Urban strip centers in dense markets run higher utilization than suburban locations."

## Preschool/Daycare
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Daycares operate more hours than K-12 schools (typically 6:30am-6:30pm for working parents) but still close nights and weekends. We use state licensing data and NAEYC accreditation standards for room capacity. Operating hours: ~60 per week versus 168 total = 36% of time open. During operating hours, rooms designed for 20 children often have 12-15 present (rolling drop-offs/pickups). Effective utilization: 25-32%. State health codes mandate high ventilation rates for infection control, similar to medical facilities."

## Bank Branch
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Bank branches operate limited hours—typically 9am-5pm weekdays, Saturday mornings—totaling just 45-50 hours per week (27-30% of time). During those hours, modern branches see minimal foot traffic as banking shifts digital: 20-40 customers per day in spaces designed for queues of 30-50. We calculate utilization from branch transaction data and FDIC deposit trends. Teller areas and safe deposit rooms get full conditioning regardless of traffic. Urban branches in financial districts run slightly higher traffic than suburban locations."

## Vehicle Dealership
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Dealerships present a split opportunity: showrooms (30-40% of building) follow retail traffic patterns with variable customer presence, while service bays (40-50% of building) have controlled utilization from scheduled appointments. We use NADA dealership data: showroom traffic averages 35-45% of design, peaking on Saturdays. Service bays run 60-70% utilization during business hours but close evenings. Showrooms often have high ceilings and large glass—significant conditioning load for spaces that average 40% occupancy."

## Courthouse
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Courthouses are a limited-opportunity building type due to security requirements and unpredictable docket schedules. Courtrooms themselves may sit empty between cases but require rapid climate recovery when sessions begin. We use court administration data: courtroom utilization averages 50-60% during business hours, with significant variation by jurisdiction. Public areas (lobbies, waiting rooms) follow government office patterns. Security screening areas and holding facilities have specific ventilation requirements under ACA standards."

## Public Service
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Public service buildings—DMVs, social services offices, permit centers—operate standard business hours (typically 8am-5pm weekdays) with variable public traffic. Waiting areas designed for 100 people often have 20-40 present except during peak periods. We use GSA occupancy standards and municipal facility data. Government buildings often run HVAC on fixed schedules rather than demand, presenting significant optimization opportunity. Public-facing areas see 30-50% average utilization; back-office areas follow standard office patterns."

## Gym
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Gyms have extreme peak-valley patterns: packed at 6-8am and 5-8pm (60-80% of equipment in use), nearly empty midday and late night (10-20%). We use IHRSA gym traffic data: facilities average 35-45% utilization across all operating hours. 24-hour gyms run even lower averages—overnight hours see single-digit utilization. High ventilation is required during peak times (exercising people produce 5-10x the CO2 of sedentary occupants), but that same rate conditions empty cardio floors at 2am. Group fitness rooms present additional opportunity—designed for 40 people, used 6-8 hours per day."

## Event Space
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Event spaces—banquet halls, conference centers, wedding venues—share utilization patterns with theaters and arenas: designed for peak events that occur infrequently. A typical venue hosts 2-4 events per week, each lasting 4-8 hours. Between events, spaces sit empty but require some conditioning for maintenance and pre-event prep. We calculate: 20 hours of events per week + 10 hours of setup/teardown = 30 hours conditioned out of 168 (18%). During events, occupancy varies from intimate gatherings (20% of capacity) to packed galas (100%). Weighted utilization runs 15-22%."

## Arts & Culture
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Arts and cultural venues—performing arts centers, galleries, cultural centers—blend museum (collection preservation) and venue (event-driven) characteristics. Galleries require 24/7 climate control for artwork but see visitors only during limited hours. Performance spaces follow theater patterns with sparse scheduling. We weight gallery areas (continuous conditioning, 15-25% visitor utilization) against performance spaces (event-driven, 20-25% utilization) and public areas (variable traffic). Major cultural institutions in NYC, DC, and Boston run higher utilization than regional centers."

## Sports/Gaming Center
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Sports and gaming centers—bowling alleys, ice rinks, arcades, laser tag—operate long hours but with sharp traffic peaks. We use industry data: facilities run 12-16 hours daily but average 35-45% lane/court/station utilization. Weekend afternoons hit 70-90% capacity; Tuesday mornings run 10-20%. Ice rinks have additional complexity—ice maintenance requires continuous cooling regardless of skaters present. Arcade and gaming areas see evening-heavy traffic patterns similar to entertainment venues."

## Public Transit
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Transit stations are a limited-opportunity building type due to 24/7 operation and security requirements. Station utilization follows commute patterns: packed 7-9am and 5-7pm (80-100% of design), sparse overnight (5-15%). We use transit authority ridership data by time of day. Underground stations have specific ventilation requirements for tunnel air quality and emergency smoke evacuation (NFPA 130). Savings opportunity exists primarily in mezzanines and fare areas during off-peak hours, not platform-level ventilation which must meet life-safety codes."

## Police Station
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Police stations are a limited-opportunity building type due to 24/7 operations requiring always-ready facilities. Holding areas have specific ventilation requirements under ACA detention standards. Administrative areas follow standard office utilization patterns but must remain operational around the clock. We calculate blended utilization: public-facing areas (20-30% of building) see variable traffic, holding (10-15%) requires continuous conditioning, operations areas (50-60%) run 24/7 but with shift-driven occupancy. Savings potential concentrated in administrative and training spaces during off-hours."

## Fire Station
"Percentage of HVAC energy this building can save by ventilating based on actual occupancy instead of design capacity. Fire stations are a limited-opportunity building type due to 24/7 staffing requirements. Living quarters, apparatus bays, and ready rooms must maintain comfortable conditions for crews who may be called out at any moment. We calculate from NFPA 1500 staffing requirements: stations are continuously occupied but at residential density (8-20 firefighters per shift) in buildings designed for vehicle staging and emergency response. Savings opportunity is minimal—stations cannot reduce conditioning in anticipation of low occupancy because occupancy never drops to zero and response capability must remain immediate."
