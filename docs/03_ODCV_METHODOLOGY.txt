NATIONWIDE PROSPECTOR - ODCV METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

This document describes how we estimate energy savings from Occupancy-Driven
Control Ventilation (O-DCV) for commercial buildings.

TOTAL BUILDINGS IN DATASET: 22,954

================================================================================
SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING
================================================================================

BUILDINGS WASTE ENERGY VENTILATING EMPTY SPACE
----------------------------------------------

Every commercial building has a ventilation system that brings in fresh outdoor
air. Building codes specify how much fresh air each space needs, typically
measured in CFM per person.

THE PROBLEM: Most buildings ventilate based on how many people the space was
DESIGNED for, not how many people are actually there.

Example - A typical office floor designed for 200 people:
  - The ventilation system delivers fresh air for 200 people
  - But only 120 people show up (hybrid work)
  - And 3 floors are completely vacant (no tenant)
  - The building pumps fresh air for 800 people who don't exist

That fresh outdoor air isn't free:
  - In winter: 20F outside, 70F inside - every CFM must be heated
  - In summer: 95F/humid outside, 72F/dry inside - every CFM must be cooled

VENTILATING EMPTY SPACE IS PURE WASTE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT O-DCV DOES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

O-DCV uses real-time occupancy sensors to answer: How many people are actually
in this zone right now?

Then it adjusts ventilation to match:
  - Conference room for 20 people but only 4 present? Deliver air for 4.
  - Entire floor empty at 6pm? Reduce to minimum setback.
  - Big meeting happening? Ramp up for actual headcount.

THE SAVINGS COME FROM THREE PLACES:
  1. Fan energy - fans run slower when less air is needed
  2. Heating energy - less cold outdoor air to heat in winter
  3. Cooling energy - less hot/humid outdoor air to cool in summer


================================================================================
SECTION 2: THE ESTIMATION APPROACH
================================================================================

We have data on 22,954 commercial buildings. For each one, we estimate:
What percentage of HVAC energy could O-DCV save?

We don't have occupancy sensor data for these buildings. So we use available
data to estimate the OPPORTUNITY for savings.

DATASET ODCV SAVINGS STATISTICS:
  Mean savings: 27.1%
  Median savings: 26.9%
  Range: 20.0% - 45.0%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FACTORS THAT MATTER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Factor            What It Tells Us
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Vacancy Rate      How much space has no tenant at all?
Utilization Rate  When space is leased, how fully is it used?
Building Type     Does this type of building have variable occupancy?
Year Built        Does the building have controls that can implement O-DCV?
Square Footage    Larger buildings typically have more sophisticated systems

Plus two modifiers:
  - Energy Efficiency (Energy Star score or EUI)
  - Climate Zone (colder climates have higher heating penalties)


================================================================================
SECTION 3: THE FORMULA
================================================================================

BASIC STRUCTURE
---------------

  ODCV Savings % = Floor + (Opportunity x Automation x Range) x Modifiers

Where:
  Floor       = Minimum savings even in worst case (building type specific)
  Ceiling     = Maximum realistic savings (building type specific)
  Range       = Ceiling - Floor
  Opportunity = How much empty/underutilized space exists (0 to 1)
  Automation  = How likely the building can implement O-DCV (0 to 1)
  Modifiers   = Adjustments for efficiency and climate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPPORTUNITY SCORE: THE HEART OF THE CALCULATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The critical question: When space is empty, is it still being ventilated?

DATASET OCCUPANCY STATISTICS:
  Vacancy Rate: Mean 16.0%, Median 16.0%
  Utilization Rate: Mean 58.9%, Median 60.0%

MULTI-TENANT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS (Office, Medical Office, Mixed Use)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
These have centralized HVAC systems controlled by the landlord.

When a floor is vacant, the landlord typically can't shut off ventilation:
  - Fire code requires minimum ventilation in occupied buildings
  - BMS treats "unoccupied" as "nighttime setback," not "zero"
  - Vacant floors are shown to prospective tenants
  - Systems are interconnected

Result: Vacant space is often ventilated at or near design capacity.

On top of that, leased space has its own utilization problem. With hybrid work,
a floor leased for 100 people might only have 60 on any given day.

FORMULA:
  Opportunity = Vacancy + (1 - Vacancy) x (1 - Utilization)

Example: 25% vacancy, 55% utilization
  - 25% of building is vacant but still ventilated = 25% waste
  - 75% is leased, but only 55% utilized = 75% x 45% = 34% waste
  - Total opportunity: 59%


SINGLE-TENANT / OWNER-OCCUPIED BUILDINGS (Schools, Hotels, Retail)
------------------------------------------------------------------
These don't have "vacancy" in the traditional sense.

The opportunity is driven purely by utilization - how much of the operating
time the space is actually occupied.

FORMULA:
  Opportunity = 1 - Utilization

Examples:
  - K-12 School at 45% utilization (empty summers, after 3pm) = 55% opportunity
  - Retail store at 60% utilization = 40% opportunity


24/7 AND HIGH-VENTILATION BUILDINGS (Hospitals, Labs)
-----------------------------------------------------
Some buildings can't reduce ventilation much, regardless of occupancy:
  - Hospitals must maintain high air change rates for infection control
  - Laboratories have fume hoods and safety requirements
  - Police/Fire stations operate 24/7

For these, we apply a 0.3 MULTIPLIER to the opportunity score.

FORMULA:
  Opportunity = (1 - Utilization) x 0.3


DATA CENTERS
------------
Data centers ventilate to remove heat from equipment, not for people.
Occupancy is irrelevant.

FORMULA:
  Opportunity = 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOMATION SCORE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The building needs controls sophisticated enough to implement O-DCV.

YEAR BUILT SCORE:
  Construction Era      Typical Systems                       Score
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Before 1970           Pneumatic controls, constant volume   0.00
  1970-1989             Early electronic, limited DDC         0.25
  1990-2004             DDC becoming standard, basic BMS      0.50
  2005-2014             Modern BMS, IP-based controls         0.75
  2015+                 Smart building ready, integrated      1.00

SIZE SCORE:
  Square Footage        Typical Sophistication                Score
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Under 50,000          Rooftop units, simple thermostats     0.25
  50,000-100,000        Basic BMS, some VAV                   0.50
  100,000-250,000       Full BMS, VAV throughout              0.75
  Over 250,000          Advanced BMS, sophisticated zoning    1.00

COMBINED AUTOMATION SCORE:
  Automation Score = (Year Score + Size Score) / 2

  A 2018 building of 300,000 sqft: (1.0 + 1.0) / 2 = 1.0
  A 1975 building of 60,000 sqft: (0.25 + 0.5) / 2 = 0.375

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EFFICIENCY MODIFIER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buildings that are already efficient have less waste to capture.

USING ENERGY STAR SCORE (when available):
  Score         Modifier    Meaning
  ------------------------------------------
  90+           0.85        Less waste to find
  75-89         0.95
  50-74         1.00        Average
  25-49         1.05
  Below 25      1.10        Lots of waste

USING EUI AS FALLBACK:
  EUI vs. Peer Median     Modifier
  ----------------------------------
  More than 1.5x median   1.10
  1.2x to 1.5x median     1.05
  0.85x to 1.2x median    1.00
  0.7x to 0.85x median    0.95
  Less than 0.7x median   0.90

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLIMATE MODIFIER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every CFM of outdoor air must be conditioned. The "penalty" varies by climate:

  Climate Zone      HDD        CDD           Modifier
  ------------------------------------------------------
  Northern          6,000+     500-1,500     1.10
  North-Central     4,000-6,000  1,000-2,000   1.05
  South-Central     2,000-4,000  2,000-3,000   1.00
  Southern          Under 2,000  3,000+        0.95

In Northern climates, reducing 1 CFM saves more energy because the temperature
differential is larger and the heating season is longer.


================================================================================
SECTION 4: BUILDING TYPE RANGES
================================================================================

Different buildings get different ranges because a hospital at 100% opportunity
still can't achieve the same savings as an office - the physics and code
requirements are different.

Floor and ceiling values are set based on:
  1. Operating hours and patterns
  2. Code-mandated ventilation requirements
  3. Occupancy variability
  4. System configurability
  5. Industry benchmarks and case studies

BUILDING TYPES IN DATASET (17 types):
  Office: 9,910 (43.2%)
  K-12 School: 2,580 (11.2%)
  Hotel: 2,464 (10.7%)
  Retail: 2,010 (8.8%)
  Higher Ed: 1,337 (5.8%)
  Residential Care: 963 (4.2%)
  Medical Office: 804 (3.5%)
  Supermarket: 693 (3.0%)
  Mixed Use: 500 (2.2%)
  Inpatient Hospital: 397 (1.7%)
  Venue: 291 (1.3%)
  Theater: 289 (1.3%)
  Wholesale Club: 265 (1.2%)
  Library/Museum: 220 (1.0%)
  Outpatient Clinic: 102 (0.4%)
  Restaurant/Bar: 66 (0.3%)
  Specialty Hospital: 63 (0.3%)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGH-OPPORTUNITY BUILDING TYPES (20%+ Ceiling)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OFFICE (20% - 40%) - 9,910 buildings
Ideal O-DCV profile:
  - Clear "occupied" vs "unoccupied" hours (7am-7pm weekdays)
  - High design occupancy rarely achieved
  - Massive impact from hybrid work (40-50% desks empty daily)
  - Significant vacancy (20-30% in many markets)
  - Centralized VAV systems respond well to zone control

Industry case studies show 25-35% HVAC savings from O-DCV in offices.

Floor of 20%: Even fully-occupied offices have weekends, holidays, evenings.
Ceiling of 40%: High-vacancy building in cold climate with good controls.


K-12 SCHOOL (20% - 45%) - 2,580 buildings
Extreme schedule-driven vacancy:
  - Empty every day after 3pm (25% of weekday hours)
  - Empty every weekend (29% of week)
  - Empty for summer break (10-12 weeks = 20-25% of year)
  - Empty for winter break, spring break, holidays

Total "empty" time often exceeds 50% of the year.


HIGHER EDUCATION (20% - 45%) - 1,337 buildings
Similar to K-12 but with even more variability:
  - Semester breaks (winter, spring, summer)
  - Variable class schedules (some rooms used twice a week)
  - Evening/weekend classes in some buildings, empty in others


VENUE (27% - 45%) - 291 buildings
Arenas, concert halls, convention centers are EMPTY 80%+ of the time.
A typical arena hosts 60-80 events/year - just 300-400 hours of actual use
out of 8,760 hours/year.


THEATER (18% - 40%) - 289 buildings
Broadway runs 8 shows/week x 3 hours = 24 hours of performances out of 168.
Even adding rehearsals and pre-show HVAC, theaters operate at 15-20% utilization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEDIUM-OPPORTUNITY BUILDING TYPES (15% - 35%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RETAIL STORE (15% - 35%) - 2,010 buildings
Significant intra-day variability:
  - Opening/closing: staff only (5% of design)
  - Mid-morning lull: 15-20% capacity
  - Lunch/evening rushes: 60-80% capacity
  - After close: 0%


HOTEL (15% - 35%) - 2,464 buildings
Unique room-by-room variability:
  - Occupancy rates typically 60-80% (20-40% rooms empty nightly)
  - Occupied rooms have variable presence (guests out during day)
  - Many hotels already have room-level occupancy sensing

Average US hotel occupancy: 63%. But rooms only occupied ~10 hours/day
(evening to morning). True utilization runs ~28%.


MEDICAL OFFICE (15% - 35%) - 804 buildings
Similar to office but with more predictable schedules:
  - Appointment-based occupancy
  - Clear business hours
  - Multi-tenant buildings have vacancy issues


MIXED USE (18% - 38%) - 500 buildings
Combination of office, retail, and sometimes residential:
  - Varied occupancy patterns
  - Complex HVAC zoning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOWER-OPPORTUNITY BUILDING TYPES (10% - 28%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUPERMARKET/GROCERY (10% - 25%) - 693 buildings
Operate long hours (often 6am-midnight or 24/7) with steadier traffic.
Refrigeration cases and kitchen/deli areas have specific ventilation
requirements less dependent on customer count.


RESTAURANT/BAR (10% - 25%) - 66 buildings
Predictable meal-time peaks, but kitchen runs at relatively constant
ventilation regardless of dining room occupancy (cooking exhaust requirements).
Kitchen exhaust hoods must run at full blast during all cooking - not
demand-controllable.


LIBRARY/MUSEUM (12% - 28%) - 220 buildings
Public-facing buildings with fixed operating hours, relatively steady
occupancy during open hours, limited extreme peaks or valleys.


WHOLESALE CLUB (10% - 25%) - 265 buildings
Large format retail with steady traffic patterns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITED-OPPORTUNITY BUILDING TYPES (5% - 15%)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INPATIENT HOSPITAL (5% - 15%) - 397 buildings
Fundamental constraints on ventilation reduction:
  - Infection control: Many areas require 15-25 ACH
  - 24/7 operation
  - ASHRAE 170 specifies minimum ventilation regardless of occupancy
  - Pressure relationships between zones are critical

O-DCV can help in waiting rooms, admin areas, non-clinical spaces.


SPECIALTY HOSPITAL (5% - 15%) - 63 buildings
Similar constraints to inpatient hospitals.


RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY (5% - 15%) - 963 buildings
Residents live there 24/7. Unlike an office that empties at night, nursing
homes have constant occupancy in resident rooms.


OUTPATIENT CLINIC (15% - 32%) - 102 buildings
More opportunity than inpatient - appointment-based schedules,
business hours operation, less stringent ventilation requirements.


================================================================================
SECTION 5: COMPLETE CALCULATION EXAMPLE
================================================================================

Building: 350,000 sqft Class A office in Chicago
  Vacancy: 28%
  Utilization: 52%
  Built: 2008
  Energy Star: 68
  Climate: North-Central

STEP 1: OPPORTUNITY SCORE
  Opportunity = Vacancy + (1 - Vacancy) x (1 - Utilization)
  Opportunity = 0.28 + (0.72 x 0.48)
  Opportunity = 0.28 + 0.346
  Opportunity = 0.626

STEP 2: AUTOMATION SCORE
  Year Score: 2008 = 0.75
  Size Score: 350,000 sqft = 1.0
  Automation = (0.75 + 1.0) / 2 = 0.875

STEP 3: EFFICIENCY MODIFIER
  Energy Star 68 = 1.00 (average efficiency)

STEP 4: CLIMATE MODIFIER
  North-Central = 1.05

STEP 5: CALCULATE SAVINGS
  Floor = 20%, Ceiling = 40%, Range = 20%

  Base ODCV = 0.20 + (0.626 x 0.875 x 0.20)
  Base ODCV = 0.20 + 0.110
  Base ODCV = 0.310

  Final ODCV = 0.310 x 1.00 x 1.05
  Final ODCV = 0.326 = 32.6%

This building could save approximately 32.6% of its HVAC energy through O-DCV.

================================================================================
SECTION 8: VALIDATION AND LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

WHAT MAKES THIS METHODOLOGY DEFENSIBLE
--------------------------------------
1. Grounded in physics: Ventilation energy is proportional to airflow and
   temperature differential. Reducing airflow for unoccupied spaces directly
   reduces energy.

2. Consistent with industry benchmarks: Our 20-40% range for offices aligns
   with documented O-DCV case studies showing 25-35% HVAC savings.

3. Building-type specific: Accounts for real operational differences between
   building types.

4. Uses available data appropriately: Vacancy, utilization, building
   characteristics, and efficiency metrics are reasonable proxies.

5. Conservative by design: Ranges cap savings at realistic maximums.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
1. No actual occupancy data: We estimate from vacancy/utilization.

2. Automation assumptions: Year built and size are proxies for system
   sophistication, not direct assessments.

3. Building type averages: Individual buildings may vary significantly.

4. No system-specific analysis: We don't know if a building has VAV vs
   constant volume, or actual control capabilities.

5. Utility rates not considered: Savings in kBtu don't account for
   time-of-use rates, demand charges, or fuel cost differences.

RECOMMENDED USE
---------------
These estimates are appropriate for:
  - Portfolio-level screening and prioritization
  - Initial savings projections for prospect identification
  - Benchmarking relative opportunity across buildings

For individual building proposals, these estimates should be validated with:
  - On-site assessment of HVAC systems
  - Actual occupancy data collection
  - Detailed energy modeling
