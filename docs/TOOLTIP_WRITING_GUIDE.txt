                        TOOLTIP WRITING BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

A comprehensive guide to writing effective, accessible, and user-friendly
tooltips for interface design.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT IS A TOOLTIP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tooltip is a brief, informative message that appears when a user interacts
with an element in a graphical user interface. Tooltips are triggered by mouse
hover or keyboard focus and provide supplementary context about UI elements.

PURPOSE:
- Clarify unfamiliar fields or unusual requests
- Explain the function of unlabeled icons
- Provide helpful context without cluttering the interface
- Guide users through complex features


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHEN TO USE TOOLTIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USE TOOLTIPS FOR:
  - Unlabeled or ambiguous icons
  - Form fields that require clarification
  - Features that may be unfamiliar to users
  - Supplementary information that enhances understanding
  - Explaining truncated text on hover

DO NOT USE TOOLTIPS FOR:
  - Critical information required to complete a task
  - Essential warnings or error messages
  - Content that should be permanently visible
  - Self-explanatory interface elements
  - Repeating the label of the trigger element
  - Hiding poor design decisions (tooltips are not band-aids)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. CHARACTER LIMITS & FORMATTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RECOMMENDED LIMITS:
  - Header text: 80 characters maximum
  - Body text: Up to 200 characters (use judgment based on context)
  - Total lines: 5 lines maximum
  - Longer tooltips are acceptable when:
      * Explaining complex concepts that require detail
      * Providing calculation breakdowns or formulas
      * Showing data context that aids decision-making
      * The alternative would be hiding useful information

WHEN TO USE LONGER TOOLTIPS:
  - Technical explanations that can't be simplified further
  - Data-driven insights with specific values
  - Multi-part information (e.g., "Based on X, calculated as Y, resulting in Z")
  - Educational content for less experienced users

FORMATTING RULES:
  - Use sentence case throughout (including headers)
  - Include periods only for complete sentences
  - Apply consistently across all tooltips
  - Text only - no images, headings, or interactive elements
  - Avoid links (users are already in workflow interruption)
  - For longer tooltips: use line breaks to separate distinct ideas
  - Bold key terms or values if your system supports it


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. WRITING PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. LEAD WITH THE VERB
   Start with the action, not the setup.

   BAD:  "This is the name that will be shown on your public profile"
   GOOD: "Shows your public profile name"

   BAD:  "This button is used to save your changes"
   GOOD: "Save your changes"

B. BE CONCISE
   Every word must earn its place. Cut ruthlessly.

   BAD:  "Click here in order to be able to download the file to your computer"
   GOOD: "Download file"

   BAD:  "This field is where you can enter your email address"
   GOOD: "Enter your email address"

C. BE SPECIFIC AND CONTEXTUAL
   Tailor the message to the exact element and situation.

   BAD:  "Click for more options"
   GOOD: "Filter by date, status, or category"

   BAD:  "Edit settings"
   GOOD: "Edit notification preferences"

D. USE CONCRETE EXAMPLES
   Anchor abstract fields with clear, formatted examples.

   BAD:  "Enter your project identifier"
   GOOD: "Enter project ID (e.g., PROJ-123)"

   BAD:  "Enter date"
   GOOD: "Enter date (MM/DD/YYYY)"

E. AVOID JARGON
   Use plain language your users understand.

   BAD:  "Initialize the API handshake protocol"
   GOOD: "Connect to the service"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONTENT DO'S AND DON'TS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DO:
  [ ] Provide genuinely useful information
  [ ] Keep content short and scannable
  [ ] Match the brand's tone of voice
  [ ] Test tooltips with real users
  [ ] Position tooltips to avoid obscuring related content
  [ ] Use arrows in crowded layouts to show association
  [ ] Maintain high contrast for visibility
  [ ] Be consistent - apply tooltips uniformly across similar elements

DON'T:
  [ ] Repeat the trigger element's label
  [ ] Include marketing language or value propositions
  [ ] Use directional language ("at the top", "on the left")
  [ ] Explain entire task flows in a single tooltip
  [ ] Create "information pollution" with obvious content
  [ ] Hide critical task-completion information
  [ ] Use tooltips to compensate for confusing design


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEYBOARD ACCESS:
  - Tooltips MUST be triggerable via keyboard focus, not just mouse hover
  - Users who rely on keyboards must have equal access to tooltip content

TIMING:
  - Tooltips should appear immediately on hover/focus
  - They must remain visible long enough to be read
  - Don't disappear too quickly - users need time to process

SCREEN READERS:
  - Follow WAI-ARIA guidelines for tooltip implementation
  - Ensure tooltip content is announced to assistive technologies

AVOID:
  - Directional language that assumes visual layout perception
  - Tooltips that only work with a mouse


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. EXAMPLES: GOOD VS. BAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE 1: Icon Button
  BAD:  "Button" (redundant)
  BAD:  "This button will allow you to delete the selected items" (too long)
  GOOD: "Delete selected items"

EXAMPLE 2: Form Field
  BAD:  "Password" (repeats label)
  BAD:  "Your password must contain letters and numbers and symbols" (clunky)
  GOOD: "Must include letters, numbers, and symbols"

EXAMPLE 3: Feature Explanation
  BAD:  "Click here to see more" (vague)
  BAD:  "This is a very useful feature that helps you track your progress
         over time and see how much you've accomplished" (way too long)
  GOOD: "View your progress history"

EXAMPLE 4: Data Input
  BAD:  "Enter number" (too vague)
  GOOD: "Building square footage (e.g., 50,000)"

EXAMPLE 5: Toggle Switch
  BAD:  "Toggle" (useless)
  BAD:  "Use this toggle to turn on or off the dark mode feature" (wordy)
  GOOD: "Enable dark mode"


REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES FROM A BUILDING ENERGY APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------
These production tooltips demonstrate the principles above.

EXAMPLE 6: Concrete Value + Consequence
  Field: "Carbon Limit"
  GOOD: "NYC's legal maximum emissions for office buildings (0.00758 metric
        tons CO2 per square foot annually). Exceeding this triggers fines."
  WHY:  Gives the exact number users need, explains what happens if exceeded.
        No fluff - just the fact and its consequence.

EXAMPLE 7: Explains "So What?"
  Field: "Units"
  GOOD: "Data from NYC Department of City Planning. More units = more tenants
        = greater complexity"
  WHY:  Doesn't just define the field - tells users why they should care.
        The "= greater complexity" transforms raw data into insight.

EXAMPLE 8: Demystifies Jargon With Benchmark
  Field: "ENERGY STAR Score"
  GOOD: "Data from building's most recent LL84 report (NYC's energy data
        disclosure law). Score of 75 = better than 75% of similar buildings
        nationwide."
  WHY:  Explains the acronym (LL84), then anchors the score with a concrete
        comparison. Users instantly understand what "75" means.

EXAMPLE 9: Formula + Real-World Context
  Field: "Building EUI"
  GOOD: "Energy Use Intensity (EUI) measures total annual energy use per
        square foot. Formula: EUI = Annual Energy (kBtu) ÷ Building Area
        (sq ft). Lower values mean better efficiency. NYC office median:
        ~65 kBtu/sq ft/year."
  WHY:  Defines the term, shows the formula, tells direction (lower=better),
        and provides a benchmark. User can now interpret any EUI value.

EXAMPLE 10: Source Attribution + Implication
  Field: "LL33 Grade"
  GOOD: "NYC gov's most recent energy efficiency letter grade for the
        building. Under LL33, NYC buildings must post these grades in public
        view (usually in the lobby). A low grade can jeopardize buildings'
        class A status"
  WHY:  Cites the source, explains where grades appear physically, and adds
        business context (class A status). Transforms a letter into stakes.

EXAMPLE 11: Data Provenance
  Field: "Class"
  GOOD: "Measure of office property quality. A= premium, B= good, C= basic.
        Source: CoStar"
  WHY:  Quick definition with clear scale, plus source attribution. Users
        know exactly what A/B/C mean and where the data came from.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. DECISION FRAMEWORK CHECKLIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before writing a tooltip, ask:

[ ] Is the design obvious enough without explanation?
    -> If YES, skip the tooltip

[ ] Would this tooltip hide critical information?
    -> If YES, display the information permanently instead

[ ] Am I just repeating the element's label?
    -> If YES, skip the tooltip

[ ] Can this content fit outside a tooltip?
    -> If YES, consider inline text instead

[ ] Will this tooltip raise more questions than it answers?
    -> If YES, rethink the design or provide more context elsewhere

[ ] Is this a band-aid for a confusing design?
    -> If YES, fix the design instead

FINAL QUESTION: "Is this information necessary for task completion?"
  - If NO -> Tooltip is appropriate
  - If YES -> Display it permanently on-screen


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. TOOLTIP SEQUENCES (GUIDED TOURS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using multiple tooltips in a sequence:

  - Limit to 3-4 tooltips per tour (mobile: 1 only)
  - Beyond 6 tooltips, use alternative formats (videos, help articles)
  - Avoid directional language for accessibility
  - Inform users where to find help content after dismissal
  - Ensure each tooltip can stand alone if others are dismissed


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Keep tooltips even shorter than desktop versions
  - Users tap to trigger (not hover)
  - Users tap elsewhere to dismiss
  - Test across different viewport sizes
  - Ensure tooltips don't get cut off by screen edges
  - Consider if a tooltip is necessary at all on mobile


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. DYNAMIC DATA IN TOOLTIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic tooltips use real-time data to provide personalized, contextual
information. This transforms generic explanations into specific insights.

WHY USE DYNAMIC DATA:
  - Makes tooltips immediately relevant to the user's context
  - Replaces abstract explanations with concrete values
  - Reduces cognitive load (user doesn't have to do mental math)
  - Creates a more intelligent, responsive interface

TYPES OF DYNAMIC DATA TO INCLUDE:

  A. CALCULATED VALUES
     Show the result, not just the formula.

     STATIC:  "Energy use per square foot"
     DYNAMIC: "142 kBtu/sq ft (based on 2.1M kBtu / 14,800 sq ft)"

  B. COMPARISONS & BENCHMARKS
     Context makes numbers meaningful.

     STATIC:  "Building energy score"
     DYNAMIC: "Score: 72 — 18% better than similar office buildings"

     STATIC:  "Annual energy cost"
     DYNAMIC: "$847,000/year — $4.20/sq ft (avg for this type: $5.10/sq ft)"

  C. PERCENTILES & RANKINGS
     Show where this item falls in the distribution.

     STATIC:  "Energy efficiency rating"
     DYNAMIC: "Top 15% of office buildings in this climate zone"

  D. TIME-BASED DATA
     Show trends and changes.

     STATIC:  "Usage history"
     DYNAMIC: "Down 12% from last year (was 162 kBtu/sq ft in 2023)"

  E. USER-SPECIFIC DATA
     Personalize based on user's portfolio or selections.

     STATIC:  "Portfolio average"
     DYNAMIC: "Your portfolio avg: 128 kBtu/sq ft (this building: 142)"

FORMATTING DYNAMIC TOOLTIPS:

  Pattern 1: Value + Explanation
  -----------------------------
  "[VALUE] — [what it means or how it compares]"

  Examples:
  - "142 kBtu/sq ft — 11% above the national median"
  - "$4.2M potential savings — based on upgrading to LED + smart HVAC"
  - "Grade C — meets minimum code but not ENERGY STAR qualified"

  Pattern 2: Calculation Breakdown
  --------------------------------
  "[RESULT] (calculated as [FORMULA with values])"

  Examples:
  - "142 kBtu/sq ft (2,100,000 kBtu ÷ 14,800 sq ft)"
  - "23% reduction potential (from 142 to 109 kBtu/sq ft)"

  Pattern 3: Comparison Format
  ----------------------------
  "[THIS VALUE] vs [BENCHMARK]: [DIFFERENCE]"

  Examples:
  - "This building: 142 vs. peer avg: 127 (+12%)"
  - "Current: $4.20/sq ft — Target: $3.50/sq ft (savings: $0.70/sq ft)"

  Pattern 4: Conditional Messaging
  --------------------------------
  Show different text based on the data.

  If ABOVE benchmark:
    "142 kBtu/sq ft — 12% above peer average. Efficiency upgrades recommended."

  If BELOW benchmark:
    "109 kBtu/sq ft — 14% below peer average. High performer."

  If AT benchmark:
    "127 kBtu/sq ft — On par with similar buildings."

IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:

  1. TEMPLATE STRINGS
     Use placeholders that get replaced at render time:
     "{{eui}} kBtu/sq ft — {{comparison_text}}"

  2. NULL/MISSING DATA
     Always have fallback text when data isn't available:
     - "Energy data not available for this building"
     - "Comparison pending — insufficient peer data"
     Don't show broken tooltips with "undefined" or "NaN"

  3. NUMBER FORMATTING
     - Use commas for thousands: 1,234,567 not 1234567
     - Round appropriately: $4.2M not $4,217,843.29
     - Include units: 142 kBtu/sq ft not just 142

  4. FRESHNESS INDICATORS
     If data can be stale, indicate when it was last updated:
     "142 kBtu/sq ft (as of Dec 2024)"

  5. SOURCE ATTRIBUTION
     When data comes from external sources, credit it:
     "ENERGY STAR score: 72 (source: EPA Portfolio Manager)"

EXAMPLES: STATIC VS. DYNAMIC

  EXAMPLE 1: Energy Use Intensity
  Static:  "Site EUI measures energy consumption per square foot"
  Dynamic: "Site EUI: 142 kBtu/sq ft. This is 12% above the median
           for office buildings in Climate Zone 4A (127 kBtu/sq ft)."

  EXAMPLE 2: Cost Savings
  Static:  "Potential annual savings from efficiency upgrades"
  Dynamic: "Potential savings: $127,000/year. Based on reducing EUI
           from 142 to 109 kBtu/sq ft through HVAC optimization."

  EXAMPLE 3: Compliance Status
  Static:  "Building performance standard compliance"
  Dynamic: "NYC LL97 Status: Non-compliant. Current emissions: 4.2
           kgCO2/sq ft. 2030 limit: 3.1 kgCO2/sq ft. Gap: 1.1 kgCO2/sq ft."

  EXAMPLE 4: Score Explanation
  Static:  "ENERGY STAR score from 1-100"
  Dynamic: "ENERGY STAR: 72. Outperforms 72% of similar buildings
           nationwide. Top quartile threshold is 75."
