   ```bash
   cp data/source/portfolio_data.csv TEST_SANDBOX/
   ```

2. Modify your script to point to `TEST_SANDBOX/portfolio_data.csv` instead of `data/source/portfolio_data.csv`

3. Run your test

4. When satisfied, update script back to real path and run on real data

## Files here are DISPOSABLE

You can delete everything in this folder at any time. It's just for testing.
